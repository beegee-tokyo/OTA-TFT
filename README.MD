If you have your ESP32 connected to a display, wouldn't it be nice to see the status of an OTA update in real time on this display?

I thought it is a nice little add on to my application. And as it is working fine within my ESP32 weather station, I share here as a stand alone code, which makes it easier to understand and integrate into your own application.
